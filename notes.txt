how to rewrite this beast? where to begin?
- maybe only way to begin is at the outside... keep our existing actors around for now but use them in a different way.
- this means start with the coffeehouse actor
- but then we do end up with streams that don't really produce anything (except side-effecst)

alternatives?
- make some stream that mimics it and wrap it in an actor, perhaps.
  - but they are not fully exchangeable so you'd have to write new code to mix with the old, and put more work into it
- start from the inside, smallest actor
